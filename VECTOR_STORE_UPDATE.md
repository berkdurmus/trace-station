# Vector Store Implementation Update

## Overview

The trace-station project has been updated to use a persistent vector database (FAISS) instead of the previous in-memory vector store. This change provides several benefits:

1. **Persistence**: Vector embeddings are now saved to disk and loaded on startup, eliminating the need to recreate embeddings each time the application runs
2. **Scalability**: FAISS provides better performance for larger datasets
3. **Efficient similarity search**: FAISS is optimized for fast vector similarity search

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes

- Replaced `MemoryVectorStore` with `FaissStore` from LangChain's community package
- Added persistence layer that saves vectors to disk in the `data/vector_db` directory
- Modified initialization flow to check for existing vector store before creating a new one
- Added proper error handling for vector store operations

### File Structure

The vector store is now stored in:
```
data/
  vector_db/
    faiss.index    # FAISS index file
    docstore.json  # Document metadata
```

### Technical Implementation

The implementation uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) which is a library for efficient similarity search. The integration uses LangChain's wrapper around FAISS, which handles:

- Creating and managing vector indices
- Saving and loading vector stores from disk
- Performing similarity searches

## Testing

A test script (`src/test-vectorstore.ts`) has been created to verify the vector store implementation. It demonstrates:

1. First run: Creating a new vector store and saving it to disk
2. Subsequent runs: Loading the existing vector store from disk

## Usage

The API for the `PlaywrightDocs` class remains the same, but now has improved performance and persistence. No changes are needed in how you interact with the class.

## Dependencies

The implementation uses:
- `faiss-node`: Node.js bindings for FAISS
- `@langchain/community`: LangChain's community package that includes the FAISS vector store implementation

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Implementing incremental updates to the vector store
- Adding vector store monitoring and metrics
- Supporting multiple vector stores for different document types
